# Hubscovery

http://hubscovery.com

## Why

Because github repository searching is painful.  Multi-term searching is
nearly impossible.  So you're forced to search and then sight filter as
you page through results.

## Features

* Properly handles multiple search terms (intersecting api results)
* Filters that actually work (number of watchers, forks, last pushed,
  etc)
* Some sane defaults (a few watchers, followers and pushed to in the
  last 6 months)

## Todo

* spec it out.  It was a morning spike that turned into something else,
  it needs specs.
* add permalinks, a lmgtfy for hubscovery
* javascript so it's faster (and maybe cooler)
